# PyTorch-Notebook
#this is my Pytorch notebook, the goals are to just play around with PyTorch and use programming to get familiar with it. And hopefully build something with it.
As I progress in my pursuits in science, I believe I should have the resources to improve upon prior experimentation and learning. PyTorch is a machine learning framework
used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. A number of products of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch suc has Tesla Autopilot, 
Uber's Pyro, utilizes Tensor computing (NumPy) with strong accelearation via graphics processing units (GPU), Deep Neural Networks built on a tape-based automatic differentation system.
